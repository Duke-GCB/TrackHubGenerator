# TrackHubGenerator
Python and Make tools for generating UCSC Track Hubs. These can be added as custom data to both the [UCSC Genome Browser] and the [Ensembl browser].

The trackhub data generated can be found on [GCB's trackhub server]. At present, the code expects its input data in [BedGraph format].
